## Technical problems
I encountered no major technical problems when completing the tutorials. I chose to do them in python with rabbitmq running in docker. I have not used docker much before but it was easy to set up following the tutorial, and ran without issues running it with:
- `$ docker run -it --rm --name rabbitmq -p 5672:5672 -p 15672:15672 rabbitmq:4.0-management`
