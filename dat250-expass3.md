## Expass 3

### Technical problems

I did not encounter any significant technical problems under installation. 

I had never user Svelte before but the syntax was not that different from other similar frameworks and finding documentation for the things I wondered about was easy as well so it was not that difficult to get used to. 

To make voting work well I had to change some things about how I stored votes from the previous assignment, as I did not store them in the poll previously.

### Pending issues

I didn't make components for all the REST-endpoint from expass 2 since the assignment did not ask for this. I did make components for the ones asked for (creating user, creating poll, voting on existing poll). 

There are also issues like security since there are no passwords and username and email of currently signed in user is stored is JS. I chose not to solve these issues as they did not seem relevant to the assignment.
